  - title: Main Functionality
    desc:
      Fit the model with `SLOPE()`, visualize the results with `plot.SLOPE()`,
      and produce predictions for new data with `predict.SLOPE()`.

    desc: Analyze the cluster strucure from SLOPE fits
  - contents:
      - plotClusters
  - title: Model Tuning
    desc:
      Use `cvSLOPE()` to perform cross-validation for selecting the optimal
      regularization parameters, `plot.TrainedSLOPE()` to visualize the results,
      and `refit()` to fit the final model to your data set.
