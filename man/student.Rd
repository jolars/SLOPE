382 observations from 13 variables represented as a list consisting
of a binary factor response matrix \code{y} with two responses: \code{portugese} and
\code{math} for the final scores in period three for the respective subjects.
The list also contains \code{x}: a sparse feature matrix of class
'dgCMatrix' with the following variables:

for Gabriel Pereira}

\description{
A data set of the attributes of 382 students in secondary education
collected from two schools. The goal is to predict the
grade in math and Portugese at the end of the third period. See the
cited sources for additional information.
}
\section{Preprocessing}{

All of the grade-specific predictors were dropped from the data set.
(Note that it is not clear from the source why some of these predictors are
specific to each grade, such as which parent is the student's guardian.)
The categorical variables were dummy-coded. Only the final grades (G3)
were kept as dependent variables, whilst the
first and second period grades were dropped.
