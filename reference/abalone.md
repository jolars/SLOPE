# Abalone

This data set contains observations of abalones, the common name for any
of a group of sea snails. The goal is to predict the age of an
individual abalone given physical measurements such as sex, weight, and
height.

- weight_whole:

  weight of entire abalone

- weight_shucked:

  weight of meat

- weight_viscera:

  weight of viscera
