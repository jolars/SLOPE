# Generate Predictions from SLOPE Models

Return predictions from models fit by
[`SLOPE()`](https://jolars.github.io/SLOPE/reference/SLOPE.md).

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'SLOPE'
predict(object, x, alpha = NULL, type = "link", simplify = TRUE, sigma, ...)

# S3 method for class 'GaussianSLOPE'
predict(
  object,
  x,
  sigma = NULL,
  type = c("link", "response"),
  simplify = TRUE,
  ...
)

# S3 method for class 'BinomialSLOPE'
predict(
  object,
  x,
  sigma = NULL,
  type = c("link", "response", "class"),
  simplify = TRUE,
  ...
)

# S3 method for class 'PoissonSLOPE'
predict(
  object,
  x,
  sigma = NULL,
  type = c("link", "response"),
  exact = FALSE,
  simplify = TRUE,
  ...
)

# S3 method for class 'MultinomialSLOPE'
predict(
  object,
  x,
  sigma = NULL,
  type = c("link", "response", "class"),
  exact = FALSE,
  simplify = TRUE,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  an object of class `"SLOPE"`, typically the result of a call to
  [`SLOPE()`](https://jolars.github.io/SLOPE/reference/SLOPE.md)

- x:

  new data

- alpha:

  penalty parameter for SLOPE models; if `NULL`, the values used in the
  original fit will be used

- type:

  type of prediction; `"link"` returns the linear predictors,
  `"response"` returns the result of applying the link function, and
  `"class"` returns class predictions.

- simplify:

  if `TRUE`, [`base::drop()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/drop.html) will be
  called before returning the coefficients to drop extraneous dimensions

- sigma:

  deprecated. Please use `alpha` instead.

- ...:

  ignored and only here for method consistency

- exact:

  if `TRUE` and the given parameter values differ from those in the
  original fit, the model will be refit by calling
  [`stats::update()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/update.html) on the object
  with the new parameters. If `FALSE`, the predicted values will be
  based on interpolated coefficients from the original penalty path.

## Value

Predictions from the model with scale determined by `type`.
