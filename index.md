# SLOPE

Efficient implementations for Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation (SLOPE):
generalized linear models regularized with the sorted L1-norm. There is
support for ordinary least-squares regression, binomial regression,
multinomial regression, and poisson regression, as well as both dense
and sparse predictor matrices. In addition, the package features
predictor screening rules that enable efficient solutions to
high-dimensional problems.
